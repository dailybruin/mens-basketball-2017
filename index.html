          <p>Points UCLA averaged per game. The Bruins had one of the most electric offenses in the country and were ranked second nationally in offensive efficiency according to KenPom.com. They also led the NCAA in points per game by the end of the regular season.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="number2">
          <p class="number">89</p>
          <p>In defensive efficiency. As good as the Bruins are offensively, they struggled to find consistency on the defensive end. No Final Four team in the last ten years had a defensive efficiency higher than 30, but UCLA’s turned the corner in defense the last couple of months.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="number3">
          <p class="number">21.7</p>
          <p>Assists per game. No team shared the ball as much as the Bruins. Coach Steve Alford revamped the team to model the Golden State Warriors and it paid off with a 28-3 record.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="number4">
          <p class="number">13</p>
          <p>Straight wins. UCLA didn’t drop a game until a loss  to then-No. 21 Oregon in Eugene on a buzzer beating 3. Their 13-0 start was the first time they went undefeated in nonconference play since the 1994-95 season where they also won the National Championship.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="number5">
          <p class="number">6</p>
          <p>Players averaging 10 or more points per game. Senior Bryce Alford and freshman T.J. Leaf lead the Bruins with 16.2 points a game, but all five starters and sixth man Aaron Holiday are capable of lighting it up on any given night.</p>

        <div class="number6">
          <p class="number">1</p>
          <p>Goal left for the team. In a postgame press conference, Lonzo Ball said the real season starts now. It’s the postseason and for the Bruins a chance to capture the 12th National title in program history and the first since 1995.</p>

            <h1> This was supposed to be a new UCLA team - a group of talented freshmen were in Westwood and one of the worst seasons in program history was behind them.  But no one was sure just how good they'd be or how far freshman point guard Lonzo Ball would take the Bruins.  </h1>

Texas A&M pushed UCLA down to the wire, their first close game of the season, but the Bruins came out on top and grabbed what they hoped would be their first title of the season at the Wooden Legacy.</div>

For the second year in the row, they upset No. 1 Kentucky, this time on at Rupp Arena. The win moved them to 9-0 on the season and bumped them up into the top-10.</div>
                </div>

UCLA lost on the road to Oregon on Dillon Brooks' buzzer-beating three. The Bruins were down at half, but reclaimed the lead before the Ducks' took over in the final minutes to win 89-87. It was a wake-up call that their fast-paced offense needed to be supplemented by a more consistent defense.</div>

But the Bears, behind sophomore Ivan Rabb, made a last minute push. UCLA hung on though to secure the 81-71 win.</div>
                    </div>

But for the first time in the Steve Alford era, the Bruins were able to sweep a conference road-trip. They ran by Colorado 104-89 before sneaking an 83-82 win over Utah.</div>

UCLA never got into a rhythm and couldn't break through against the Arizona defense, falling 96-85. </div>

USC won the fourth straight rivalry game and handed UCLA its second straight and third overall loss. After the game, coach Steve Alford said the team was mentally and physically fatigued but would regroup before the second half of Pac-12 play.</div>

Washington's Markelle Fultz squared off with Ball with more than 20 league scouts watching, but it was all UCLA as the Bruins won 107-66.</div>

UCLA got revenge on the Ducks with another dramatic comeback. Freshman Lonzo Ball hit the dagger 3 to put his team up up five with 32 seconds to go, a lead they wouldn't squander.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-item fade">

UCLA avenged their loss to USC, and ended a four-game losing streak to their crosstown rivals, with a 102-70 win at Pauley Pavilion. </div>

The Wildcats had a chance to tie the game down the stretch, but couldn't hit the three and the Bruins held on for the win.</div>
                </div>

Freshman forward T.J. Leaf left the game early in the first half with a left ankle sprain with just a week until the postseason. Coach Steve Alford later said that he hoped to have Leaf ready to go for the Pac-12 tournament in Vegas.</div>

UCLA edged USC 76-74 to move on to the Pac-12 semifinals where they'll take on another team that defeated them earlier in the year, No. 7 Arizona.</div>
